Hi, I'm Niko. Iâ€™m a goal-oriented, creative and self-motivated QA engineer. I have experience in working with API testing (Postman), Unit testing (Jest) and Automotive testing (Cypress). I am well familiar with Test design techniques, test suits creating and executing. Also have strong knowledge of HTML, Sass preprocessor, JS, cross-browser and adaptive markup skills. Eager to improve my skills, always try to learn new technologies and stay up-to-date with Quality Assurance trends. I also learn quickly and easily communicate with people.
